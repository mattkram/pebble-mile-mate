### What is this repository for? ###

* MileMate is an application for the Pebble smartwatch
* The application allows the user to input filling data when refueling their vehicle
* The data is placed into a Google Sheet, which in turn is used as a filling database

The filling data are compiled and processed by a web server running on a RaspberryPi on my home network. The web server is built using the cherrypy Python module.
